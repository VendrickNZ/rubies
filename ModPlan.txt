Create Blocks of Ruby, Ruby Ore, Raw Ruby, Ruby Nugget, and Ruby.
Then I make Ruby Ore generate naturally in the world, then when you break them with a pickaxe, you get Raw Ruby.
When you get Raw Ruby you can put it into a furnace to make a Ruby.
You can use Rubies to make Ruby Armor/Weapons

Rubies are going to require a diamond pickaxe to break, going to spawn exactly like diamonds, but have better stats.

Goals:
Make ruby nugget
Raw ruby in a furnace makes a ruby
9 ruby nuggets makes a ruby
